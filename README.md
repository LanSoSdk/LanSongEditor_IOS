  - **Gesture operation**: after adding pictures and videos, return to a layer, which is a layer-by-layer design. All layers support gestures; can be selected and moved with one finger; zoom and rotate with two fingers ;
  - **Animation**: There are entrance animation, exit animation, and animation at any point in time; the animation is exported to the json format supported by the SDK after the Adobe After Effect software is completed, so that you can freely play different animations and SDKs Only one export file is needed at the end, and the animation effect can be presented after loading.
